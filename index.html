<h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
<p class="me">
  András István Arató is a retired Hungarian electrical engineer and model. Best known for becoming an internet meme, András has been in and out of the stock photo and advertisement industry as a model since disclosing his identity. Arató's modeling for stock photography garnered attention as soon as 2011, coming to be known in meme culture as "Hide the Pain Harold" due to his overall facial expression and seemingly fake smile.

  He took up traveling to foreign countries such as Turkey and Russia for recreational purposes and kept a blog about his life and travels. The photos associated with such travels are said to be the cause of Arató's fame. While vacationing in Turkey, András Arató decided to upload personal vacation photos onto social media site iWiW, which were noticed by a photographer.

  Born in 1945 and hailing from Kőszeg, Hungary, András Arató was raised in the era of the Iron Curtain. He has stated that a major part of his childhood was a gargantuan chestnut tree growing in his hometown. He would reminisce about it as if it were a tree of wisdom in his town as many do of landmarks in their own lives. Not much else is currently known about Arató's teenage and pre-university years. In 1969, Arató graduated from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics under the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.
   After retirement, András Arató worked as a DJ for a local radio station for 5 years. In 2019, he became the advertising face for Coca-Cola in Hungary. In 2020, he starred in the Hungarian edition of Masked Singer (known in Hungary as Álarcos énekes), broadcast on the TV station RTL Klub.
   Arató currently lives in Budapest with his wife Gabriella and his son.
